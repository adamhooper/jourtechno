title: About Jour(tech)no

This site has two goals:

* Teach journalists how computer tools can produce stories
* Inspire techies to get involved in journalism

I'm [Adam Hooper](http://adamhooper.com), a hybrid software engineer and journalist. I've published stories, photographs and interactive websites with publications you've heard of. I work on [Overview](https://www.overviewproject.org) and [Emergent](http://www.emergent.info).
